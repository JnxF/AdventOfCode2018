# Advent Of Code 2018

## Official description

<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018">Advent of Code</a> is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## This repository

As this term I'm learning C# at the university, I thought that it would be a funny idea to
solve this year's challenges using this language.
